# Contributing to Our Project

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Every contribution helps, and we truly appreciate the effort. This document explains our guidelines and the steps for contributing. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and suggest enhancements. These are a great place to ask questions and get help for the project. 

### Before Submitting a New Issue

Before you submit an issue, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or enhancement has already been filed. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue.

### How to Submit a New Issue

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click the "Issues" tab.
3. Click the "New Issue" button.
4. Choose "Bug Report" to create a report to help us improve or "Feature Request" to suggest an idea for the project.
5. Use the provided template to create your issue.

## Code Contributions

Here's a quick guide on how to contribute code:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Clone your fork down to your local environment.
3. Make your changes in your local environment.
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request with a comprehensive description of the changes.
6. Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request and merge it.

## Pull Requests

When you submit a pull request, please make sure to link the issue you're addressing. For example, by writing "Resolves #123" in the pull request description, the issue #123 will automatically close when the pull request is merged.
