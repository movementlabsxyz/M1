## Introduction

The Move programming language poses numerous benefits to builders including direct interaction with digital assets through custom resource types, flexibility with transaction script declaration, on-chain verification, and bytecode safety privileges.

Movement M1 is designed for the Avalanche subnet, allowing users to seamlessly interact with and build with the Move language on a high-performance, modular, scalable and interoperable Layer 1.

- Movement will be able to hit 160,000+ theoretical TPS as the project scales to provide much needed performance to protocols.
- Move bytecode verifiers and interpreters provide native solvency for the reentrancy attacks and security woes that have plagued Solidity developers for years, resulting in $3 billion lost last year.

This repository contains the code and contributor documentation for M1. If you would like to learn how to use and develop for the platform, please visit [https://docs.movementlabs.xyx](https://docs.movementlabs.xyz).

## Features

Currently, M1 consists of...
- Devnet: [https://devnet.m1.movementlabs.xyz](https://devnet.m1.movementlabs.xyz)
- Testnet (Coming soon): [https://testnet.m1.movementlabs.xyz](https://testnet.m1.movementlabs.xyz)

## Installation
